# Usage

Download the repo and run DemoAudio.ipynb.
Record audio using a 16-channel microphone array and upload the .wav file. Change the mixedaudio variable name to your new .wav file in DemoAudio.ipynb.

Run all blocks under dependencies and run "Running" for every new file.

The folder example_audio has an example 16-channel, multi-speaker recording and a single-channel, masked audio result.
